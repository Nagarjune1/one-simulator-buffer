Title: Buffer Management Strategies in Opportunistic Device-to-Device Networks

In this project, we will implement and explore <b>buffer management strategies</b> for devices in opportunistic D2D networks. The focus in this project is the <b>ReqResRouter</b> within the router folder where I implemented this <b>Information Centric Networking (ICN)</b> methodology.

The ICN methodology involves having small interest packet looking for data packets instead of having the router spread or flood data packets everywhere regardless of whether nodes have interest in them.
