Title: Buffer Management Strategies in Opportunistic Device-to-Device Networks

In this project, we will implement and explore buffer management strategies for devices in opportunistic D2D networks. Such strategies are necessary to choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones when the buffer is full. We will implement and explore strategies including but not limited to Least-Recently-Used (LRU), Least-Frequently-Used (LFU), Random-Replacement (RR), and Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) under different store-carry-and-forward routing protocols in opportunistic D2D networks. The goal is to determine the optimal buffer management strategy under each type of routing protocol.
